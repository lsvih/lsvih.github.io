# Introduction

#### How to build knowledge graphs?

1. *domain discovery*
> spider & domain ontology
2. *information extraction system*
> CRFs & DNN -> extraction of name entities and relationship

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While IE has been well-studied both for cross-domain Web sources (e.g. Wikipedia) and for traditional domains, it is less well-studied for dynamic domains that undergo frequent changes in content and structure.
---

#### Challenges to illicit domain IE system:

1. deliberate information obfuscation
2. non-random misspelling of common words
3. high occurrences of OOV and uncommon words
4. frequent use of Unicode characters
5. sparse content
6. heterogeneous website structure
7. ...

#### Examples

Hey gentleman im neWY0rk and iâ€™m looking for generous...

#### High level overview

.center[High-recall recognizer 

+

Supervised feature-agnostic classification algorithm]

---
#### Contribution

Present a lightweight feature-agnostic information extraction system for a highly heterogeneous, illicit domain like human trafficking

#### Baseline

latest Stanford Named Entity Resolution system (CRF)

# Related Work

**Open IE**

*The specific problem of devising feature-agnostic, low-supervision IE approaches for illicit Web domains has not been studied in prior work*

---
#Approach

####1. Pre-processing
####2. Deriving Word Representations
####3. Applying High-Recall Recognizers
####4. Supervised Contextual Classifier

---
## Pre-processing

#### 1. Scrape website

#### 2. Extract text

> RTE(Readability Text Extractor)

> Tune RTE to achieve high recall

> https://www.readability.com/developers/api

#### 3. Tokenizer

> NLTK

---
## Deriving Word Representations

**Random Indexing**

> Naive version of thie Random Indexing algorithm

> Improve: define some **compound unit**

-----

| Unit name |  Definition |
| --- | --- |
| High-idf-units |  Units occurring in fewer than fraction theta (by default, 1%) of initial corpus |
| Pure-num-units |  Numerical units |
| Alpha-num-units |  Alpha-numeric units that contain at least one alphabet and one number |
| Pure-punct-units | Units with only punctuation symbols |
| Alpha-punct-units | Units that contain at least one alphabet and one punctuation character |
| Nonascii-unicode-units | Units that only contain non-ASCII characters |

-----

RI algorithm **only** learn a single vector for each compound unit.

# Evaluations

### Dataset

DARPA MEMEX program.

### Ground-truths

Apply four high-recall recognizer for a website in a part of dataset, and manually verifying.

### Attribute

1. City (in HTML title)
2. City (in scraped text)
2. State
3. Name
4. Age

### System

Author developed 4 high-recall recognizers:

1. GeoNames-Cities
2. GeoNames-States
3. RegEx-Ages
4. Dictionary-Names

> Cities and states dataset relies on http://www.geonames.org/ (A freely avaliable geoname dataset)

> Ages recognizer can only recognise age between 18 and 31.

> Name dictionaries are collected from freely dataset in muiltiple contries and languages.

---

### Baseline

*Stanford Named Entity Recognition system(NER)*

> Re-trained at randomly samplying 30% of ground-truth dataset, remaining annotations used for testing.

> Re-trained at randomly samplying 70% of ground-truth dataset, remaining annotations used for testing.
